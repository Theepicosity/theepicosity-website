		<h2><i>lipu pi kule epiku Atawan</i></h2>
		<br/>
		Hi! My name is Theepicosity, also known as kule epiku Atawan or by my real name, Adrian Edgar. After all these years, I finally have a website!<br/>
		<i><fl>Variations on my name include: TheepicosityEpic, k.e. Atawan, theepie, or (for short) theep, epic, atawan, kule epiku, adri, and <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/235138363131166728/317504809433300992/543221819990212618">osi</a>.</i></fl><br/><br/>
		If you know me, you probably know me from... well, a lot of things, actually. I'm just a girl on the internet who likes to make fun and cute things. :3<br/><br/>
		My really short bio: I'm 18 years old, born on March 4th. I live in San Tan Valley, Arizona. (GMT-7) I often use a lizard profile picture, even though I have three pet rats. My favorite game is Tower of Heaven, although Kitten Burst is a close second. I'm a fluent Toki Pona speaker. I'm transgender (she/her), biracial (black & white), and I look like <a href="http://lipu-pi-ijo-pi-toki.pona.la/ante/mi/nilimi.jpg">this</a>!<br/><br/>
		ATM, I don't have too many things to populate my site with, aside from some links; <a href="http://lipu-pi-ijo-pi-toki.pona.la/">my Toki Pona site</a> is generally more informative. (as long as you speak toki pona...) If you want, you can pretend that there is a huge geocities "under construction" sign here. :)<br/>
		<i><fl>As a fun fact: my favorite font is Volkhov, which is both my system font and the font on this website!</i></fl><br/><br/>

		<h3>Links!</h3><br/>
		You can find my music at many places, including: <a href="https://theepicosity.newgrounds.com/">Newgrounds</a>, <a href="https://theepicosity.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5lrWEPuLc3RQO3CwzVDv8J?si=QRyiDcN7RRyynKCwnxvc2A">Spotify</a>. (other streaming services may do as well!)<br/>
		<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2170500/Voxella/">Voxella on Steam</a>, as well as <a href="https://theepicosity.itch.io/">my itch.io page</a> for other random games.<br/>
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZjPaL1zsLRIuOW79nWKZKg">My Youtube channel</a> (not interesting)<br/>
		<i><fl>I exist variously in many other corners of the web as well!</i></fl><br/><br/>
		Contact e-mail: adrianedgar[at]proton[dot]me<br/>
		Shooting a Newgrounds PM also works just as well for contact; contacting me on Discord is chill too, but I won't be putting my discord username on here to avoid spam.<br/><br/>
