		Hi! My name is Theepicosity, also known as kule epiku Atawan or by my real name, Adrian. After all these years, I finally have a website!<br/>
		<i><fl>Variations on my name include: TheepicosityEpic, k.e. Atawan, theepie, or (for short) theep, epic, atawan, kule epiku, adri, and <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/235138363131166728/317504809433300992/543221819990212618">osi</a>.</i></fl><br/><br/>

		If you know me, you probably know me from... well, a lot of things. I'm a girl on the internet who likes to make fun and cute things. :3<br/><br/>

		My really short bio: I'm 19 years old, born on March 4th. (pisces!) I live in Phoenix, Arizona. (GMT-7) I often use a lizard profile picture, even though I have three pet rats. My favorite game is Tower of Heaven, although Kitten Burst is a close second. I'm a fluent Toki Pona speaker. I'm transgender (she/her), biracial (black & white), and I look like <a href="http://lipu-pi-ijo-pi-toki.pona.la/ante/mi/nilimi.jpg">this</a>!<br/><br/>

		<h3>Links!</h3>
		You can find my music at many places, including: <a href="https://theepicosity.newgrounds.com/">Newgrounds</a>, <a href="https://theepicosity.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5lrWEPuLc3RQO3CwzVDv8J?si=QRyiDcN7RRyynKCwnxvc2A">Spotify</a>. (other streaming services may do as well!)<br/>
		<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2170500/Voxella/">Voxella on Steam</a>, as well as <a href="https://theepicosity.itch.io/">my itch.io page</a> for other random games.<br/>

		<a href="http://lipu-pi-ijo-pi-toki.pona.la/">My Toki Pona website!</a><br/>
		<i><fl>I exist variously in many other corners of the web as well!</i></fl><br/><br/>
		The main way to contact me is via e-mail: k.e.atawan[at]theepicosity[dot]space<br/>
		Shooting a Newgrounds PM also works just as well for contact; contacting me on Discord is chill too, but I won't be putting my discord username on here to avoid spam.
