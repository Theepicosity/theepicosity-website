		<h1>Stellology</h1>
		<br/>
		Stellology is a non-scientific study of constellations and divinings via the stars. It is my own invented branch of astrology!
		<br/><br/>
		The main difference between stellology and Western astrology is that Western astrology primarily concerns itself with the 12 signs of the zodiac. Stellology, on the other hand, uses all 88 IAU designated constellations which are frequently used for locating astronomical phenomena. It also does not concern itself with the planets, sun, or moon-- just the stars!
		<br/><br/>
		Stellology has two signs: the <b>imposed sign</b> and the <b>projected sign</b>. The <b>imposed sign</b> is the easier of the two to calculate: it is determined by your birth date, similarly to the Sun sign in Western astrology. There may also be other types of imposed signs, for instance, you could have one based on your birth time (akin to a Moon sign in Western astrology). The <b>projected sign</b> is more complicated: it is the sign that was directly overhead when you were born. This is harder to calculate, and also less interesting because it involves more repeats. You can calculate this based off of your birth date, birth time, and birth location.
		<br/><br/>
		Stellology is based around the sidereal year rather than the tropical year, so times will drift very slightly from year to year. The times themselves are calculated based on the incline towards the alpha star in the given constellation.
		<br/><br/>
		Below you will find a list of all 88 constellations. Each entry includes additional information, like the stars involved, best viewing times, and history of the name and contellation. It also includes stellalogical information, such as a divination, a symbol, and the dates with which you can determine your own sign.
