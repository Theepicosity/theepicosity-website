		<h1>Theepicosity - Now</h1>
		<br/>
		Here's stuff that I'm doing right now!<br/><br/>
		<b>Short-term:</b> Aside from working on my new website, I'm also making a resource pack of Terraria remixes, which I am very excited for!<br/><br/>
		<b>Long-term:</b> I'm working on a new music-based arcade game, and, slightly longer-term, I'm continuing to work on my game Voxella. I'm also constantly making music.<br/><br/>
		<b>Ideas:</b> I've been toying around with the idea of making a web-based platformer game, porting Tower of Heaven to desktop, making a Terraria modpack, making a mashup album, new Open Hexagon levels, and getting back into the Beepbox modding scene.<br/><br/>
