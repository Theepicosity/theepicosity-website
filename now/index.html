		<h1>Theepicosity - Now</h1>
		<br/>
		Here's stuff that I'm doing right now!<br/><br/>
		<b>Short-term:</b> I'm working on a mod for Beepbox, I'm writing a story in Toki Pona, and I'm continuing to make Open Hexagon levels.<br/><br/>
		<b>Long-term:</b> I'm working on a new music-based arcade game, and, slightly longer-term, I'm continuing to work on my game Voxella. I'm also looking at making a new music album, and finish my Terraria music resource pack!<br/><br/>
		<b>Ideas:</b> There are a few new stories that I want to write, both in English and in Toki Pona. I also had an idea for an rpg that I really want to make!<br/><br/>
